# object_detection_project

Project to detect objects in images and real time using a webcam.

Project steps:
1. Collect and Label images for Object Detection using LabelImg - in this case all images were food items
2. Train Deep Learning powered Object Detection Models using Python and TFOD - A pre-trained Tensorflow model was used in this project.
3. Detect objects in real time using a webcam and using Images
4. Tune Object Detection models to improve Precision and Recall
5. Export the model to Tensorflow JS for integration in React JS web apps
6. Export the model to TFLite for use on a Raspberry Pi
